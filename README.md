# rsa
Just a simple encrpyter for .txt files. Uses a python gui and that calls a C program to encrpyt your files. 
The C program has the ability to both encrpyt and decrpyt but since I am still working making the decryption better,
I have only given the gui the ability to encrypt files.

The C file can be run individually.
