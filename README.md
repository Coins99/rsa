# rsa
Just a simple encryptor for .txt files. It uses a Python GUI that calls a C program to encrypt your files.
The C program has the ability to both encrypt and decrypt, but since I am still working on improving the decryption,
I have only given the GUI the ability to encrypt files.

The C file can be run independently.
